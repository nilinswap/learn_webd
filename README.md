## Caveats

- look at the file structure
- use my-file.html in place of my_file.html. i.e. for naming web files use hyphens
- style sheets are included in header part while javascript is included in body.

## CSS
![css shit](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9461/css-declaration-small.png)
- It is mostly based on the idea of boxes.
- padding, the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text).
- border, the solid line that sits just outside the padding.
- margin, the space around the outside of the element.
- difference between margin and padding is former is space 
declartion for outside of the div while padding is for inside. see [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/creative-professional/whats-difference-margin-padding).
- position of script tag matters. inline html overwrites loaded javascript if script tag is the first thing after <body> opening tag
therefore it is a better idea to include script before </body> closing tag.

## oppresseds

- user unit vs screen units - user agent can determine from its environment that "1px" corresponds to "0.2822222mm" this migh be different for laptop and computres
